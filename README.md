-> How did you approach your task?
-> What were the challenges you faced?
   
   Task 1 : 
   It was quite simple, I created a list then I used append to add the given URL in the list, the i used for    loop to make each character of URL come one by one. Then with the use of slicing I did all the required      operations.
  
  Task 2:
  The operations performed in this task were totally new to me. I went through the given refrences and the     blog thoroughly.The process was of Data Cleaning. I downloaded the given dataset and tried to understand     it. I used the given codes in the blog to perform the data cleaning operation. I debugged the code and       managed to get the required output.
  
  I came to know a lot about What is Data Science though these tasks. In task 2, we were given some raw data   which was totally messed up, we used differnt operartions in the python and made the data which can be       readable by the user.
  
  
-> About me :

  My name is Gaurav Singh, Btech CSE (Ist Year), from Moradabad, UttarPradesh.
  I am new to programming but I have learned some basics of Python language in recent times, hence I chose     these data science tasks. I am also interested in Web Development but honestly I dont know much about HTML   and CSS.
  I would like to join TechnoJam Club to explore more about programming and coding.
  
  Peace :-)
